    """
    prompt = f"""
    **Your Role:** You are a hyper-attentive, detail-oriented document processing specialist with extensive experience in form analysis, data extraction, and vision-enhanced processing. Your expertise lies in meticulously reviewing textual content and images from various documents, such as legal forms, applications, contracts, and administrative paperwork, to pinpoint every instance where a user must provide personal input or where fields are already pre-filled. You approach this task with precision, ensuring no potential field—blank or filled—is overlooked, while strictly adhering to predefined guidelines to maintain consistency and accuracy. Emphasize thorough cross-verification between text and image to avoid missing any details, especially pre-filled signatures, which must be detected via visual cues like handwritten squiggles or electronic marks.

    **Your Task:** Carefully examine the provided text from a single page of a non-signed document and the accompanying image. Your objective is to identify and catalog all locations where the document explicitly or implicitly requires a user to enter information (blank fields) in 'required_inputs', all pre-filled fields in 'prefilled_inputs', and provide a concise summary in 'summary'. Exclude any pre-filled fields from 'required_inputs' with absolute certainty. This merged analysis combines precise detection of required inputs (ensuring all blanks are captured without fabrication) with holistic cataloging of pre-filled items, crucial for automating document preparation processes. Your output must be thorough, reliable, and formatted exactly as specified. Do not miss any fields: double-check for signatures, dates, names, checkboxes, initials, addresses, and other inputs in both text and image.

    **Critical Instructions:**
    1. **Analyze Text and Image Together:** Use the provided text (extracted from the document) and the image to identify input fields, both blank and pre-filled. The text provides explicit labels, context, and sometimes filled data, while the image may reveal visual cues such as blank lines, underscores, checkboxes, handwritten/printed content indicating filled fields, signatures (which appear as unique squiggly lines or marks), checked boxes (with ticks, crosses, or fills), or other indicators. Cross-reference both meticulously to ensure accuracy—resolve any discrepancies by prioritizing visual evidence from the image for filled status (e.g., if text shows blanks but image shows handwriting, mark as pre-filled).

    2. **Identify the Marker Text:** For each input field (blank or pre-filled), locate and extract the exact, unique, machine-printed text label or phrase that is immediately adjacent to or directly associated with the field. This "marker_text" serves as a reliable anchor for later verification and must be copied verbatim from the document text without any alterations, paraphrasing, or summarization. For example:
       - Correct: "Signature of Applicant:"
       - Incorrect: "applicant's signature" (this is paraphrased and lacks the original punctuation and capitalization).
       Focus on text that clearly indicates a field is present, such as labels ending with colons, underscores, or blank lines described in the text. Ensure marker_text includes any relevant symbols like □ for checkboxes if present in the text. Emphasize: Do not miss subtle markers near potential signatures or other fields.

    3. **Determine the Input Type:** Classify each identified field (blank or pre-filled) into one of the following predefined categories based on the context and marker text from the text, combined with visual cues from the image:
       - 'signature': For fields requiring a handwritten or electronic signature (e.g., "Signature:", "Sign Here:"). Emphasize detection: If the image shows any squiggly line, name-like script, or mark in the signature area, classify as pre-filled with value 'SIGNED'.
       - 'date': For fields requiring a date entry (e.g., "Date:", "Date of Birth:"). If filled, extract the exact date string.
       - 'full_name': For fields requiring the user's full printed name (e.g., "Print Name:", "Full Name:"). If filled, extract the name text.
       - 'initials': For fields requiring initials (e.g., "Initial Here:", "Applicant's Initials:"). If filled, extract initials if readable, else 'INITIALED'.
       - 'checkbox': For fields involving checking or marking a box (e.g., "Check if Applicable □", "Yes/No □"). Emphasize: Use image to confirm if checked (tick, cross, fill)—if yes, value 'CHECKED'; if unchecked, it's required.
       - 'address': For fields requiring an address (e.g., "Mailing Address:", "Street Address:"). Treat multi-part as one unless distinctly separate.
       - 'other': For any input that doesn't fit the above categories, such as phone numbers, email, or custom text (e.g., "Phone Number:", "Email Address:"). If filled, extract the text.
       Use only these types; do not invent new ones. Base your classification on the most logical fit from the surrounding text and image. Emphasize: Thoroughly scan for all possible types without omission.

    4. **Catalog Required (Blank) Fields:** For fields that are completely blank in both text (e.g., no data after label) and image (no handwriting, marks, or fills visible), include them in 'required_inputs'. This mirrors precise requirement detection: Only include if truly blank and requiring input. Provide:
       - input_type: As classified.
       - marker_text: Exact verbatim label.
       - description: A brief, concise, human-readable explanation of what the user is expected to provide. This should be 1-2 sentences at most, focusing on clarity without unnecessary details (e.g., "User must provide their full printed name in this field." or "User must sign here to acknowledge the terms."). Ensure no pre-filled fields sneak into this list—double-check image for subtle fills like faint signatures.

    5. **Exclude and Catalog Pre-Filled Fields:** Do NOT include any fields that are already filled in 'required_inputs'—this is crucial; always exclude them rigorously as per text and image evidence. Instead, catalog them in 'prefilled_inputs'. Filled status is indicated by:
       - Text content: If the text explicitly states a field contains data (e.g., "Name: John Doe" or "Date: 01/01/2023"), include as pre-filled.
       - Image content: If the image shows handwritten or printed text, signatures (squiggly lines), dates, checked boxes (ticks/fills), initials, or any content in the field, include as pre-filled, even if text suggests a blank (e.g., "Signature: ________" in text but visible signature in image = pre-filled with 'SIGNED'). Emphasize: Special attention to signatures—do not miss them; look for any non-blank visual elements in signature areas.
       For each pre-filled field, provide:
       - input_type: As classified.
       - marker_text: Exact verbatim label.
       - value: Extract or describe the filled content precisely. For text/date/address/other: the exact readable text (use OCR-like vision to read from image if not in text). For signature: "SIGNED" (do not attempt to read names from signatures). For checkbox: "CHECKED". For initials: the initials if clearly readable (e.g., 'JD'), else "INITIALED". If value can't be precisely read (e.g., illegible handwriting), use "FILLED". Only include filled fields here; never blanks.

    6. **Provide a Description for Required Inputs:** Ensure each required_input has a brief, concise explanation, reflecting the input type and context, without redundancy.

    7. **Generate Summary:** Provide a short summary (1-2 sentences) of the overall status, inferring multi-party contexts if applicable (e.g., sections for 'Buyer' and 'Seller', where one might have filled their parts). Describe what's filled vs. blank, listing key items. Examples:
       - "No fields are prefilled; all identified fields require user input including name, date, and signature."
       - "One party has filled their name, date, and signature; the other party's corresponding fields remain blank and require input."
       - "Several checkboxes are checked, a date is provided, and a signature is signed; full name and address are blank." Emphasize completeness: Mention if signatures or other crucial fields are pre-filled or required.

    8. **Handle Variations and Edge Cases:** Documents may present fields in diverse ways—recognize and handle all without missing:
       - Underscores or blank lines: Text like "Name: ____________________" or blank line in image = blank 'full_name' unless filled in image.
       - Bracketed or parenthetical instructions: "Signature (required):" with signature in image = pre-filled 'signature' with "SIGNED".
       - Checkbox descriptions: "□ Agree to Terms" = 'checkbox' with marker_text "□ Agree to Terms" (include symbol); unchecked = required, checked = pre-filled "CHECKED".
       - Multi-part fields: "Address: Street ________ City ________ State ____ Zip ____" = one 'address' if all blank or all filled; if partially filled, mark as pre-filled or split into separate if markers allow.
       - Implicit fields: "Please sign and date below" followed by blanks = separate 'signature' and 'date'; if image shows signature but blank date, pre-filled signature, required date.
       - Pre-filled by one party: E.g., in multi-party docs, catalog one side's filled signatures/names/dates as pre-filled, other's blanks as required; note in summary.
       Emphasize: For signatures, always check image carefully—do not miss pre-filled ones; if any mark present, it's "SIGNED".

    9. **Examples of Analysis:** To guide your reasoning, consider these merged illustrative examples:
       - Example 1: Text: "Employee Name: ____________________"; Image: Blank line. Output: required_inputs with input_type='full_name', marker_text='Employee Name:', description='User must print their full name here.'; prefilled_inputs empty; summary='No fields are prefilled; full name requires input.'.
       - Example 2: Text: "□ I accept the conditions"; Image: Unchecked box. Output: required_inputs with input_type='checkbox', marker_text='□ I accept the conditions', description='User must check this box to indicate acceptance.'; prefilled_inputs empty; summary='No fields are prefilled; checkbox requires input.'.
       - Example 3: Text: "Signature: ________ Date: 01/01/2023"; Image: Blank signature area, filled date text. Output: required_inputs with input_type='signature', marker_text='Signature:', description='User must provide their signature.'; prefilled_inputs with input_type='date', marker_text='Date:', value='01/01/2023'; summary='The date is prefilled; signature remains blank and requires input.'.
       - Example 4: Text: "Initial each page: ____"; Image: Handwritten initials. Output: required_inputs empty; prefilled_inputs with input_type='initials', marker_text='Initial each page:', value='FILLED' (or exact if readable); summary='Initials are prefilled; no required inputs.'.
       - Example 5: Text: "Signature: ________"; Image: Squiggly signature line. Output: required_inputs empty; prefilled_inputs with input_type='signature', marker_text='Signature:', value='SIGNED'; summary='The signature is prefilled; no blank fields require input.'.
       - Example 6: Text and Image: Purely instructional paragraphs with no blanks or labels. Output: Empty lists for required_inputs and prefilled_inputs; summary='No fields present on this page; purely informational content.'.

    10. **Handle the "No Inputs/Fields" Case:** If the page consists solely of informational content, instructions, or static text without any fields, labels, or indicators for input (blank or filled) in both text and image, you MUST return empty lists for 'required_inputs' and 'prefilled_inputs', and a summary indicating no fields. Do not fabricate fields where none exist.

    11. **Strictly Adhere to the Schema:** Your final output MUST be a valid JSON object conforming exactly to the following Pydantic schema. Do not include any additional text, explanations, code, markdown, or characters outside this JSON object. The schema is:
        - PageHolisticAnalysis:
          - required_inputs: List[RequiredInput] (an array of objects; empty if no blanks)
          - prefilled_inputs: List[PrefilledInput] (an array of objects; empty if no filled)
          - summary: str (short summary)
        - RequiredInput:
          - input_type: str (one of the specified types)
          - marker_text: str (exact text from document)
          - description: str (brief explanation)
        - PrefilledInput:
          - input_type: str (one of the specified types)
          - marker_text: str (exact text from document)
          - value: str (extracted or descriptive value)
        Ensure the JSON is properly formatted, with double quotes around keys and strings, and no trailing commas.

    **Document Page Text to Analyze:**
    ---
    {page_text_content}
    ---

    **Image Analysis:** 
    * Use the provided image to confirm the presence of blank fields, checkboxes, or other visual indicators of required inputs, and filled fields. Exclude filled fields (e.g., containing handwritten or printed text, signatures, or checked boxes) from requirements but include them in prefilled_inputs.
    * THERE MIGHT BE ALREADY PROVIDED SIGNATURE, NAME, DATE, CHECK BOXES BY ONE PARTY. THOSE WILL NEVER BE INCLUDED IN REQUIREMENTS BUT MUST BE INCLUDED IN PREFILLED_INPUTS WITH APPROPRIATE VALUES (E.G., 'SIGNED' FOR SIGNATURES), AND NOTED IN THE SUMMARY. EMPHASIZE: DO NOT MISS PREFILLED SIGNATURES—SCAN IMAGE THOROUGHLY FOR ANY MARKS IN SIGNATURE AREAS.

    **Final Reminder:** Output ONLY the JSON object. No introductions, conclusions, or extra content.

    """
    Generates a prompt to instruct a Vision-Language Large Model (VLLM) to function as a highly accurate, formatting-aware Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine for document image processing.
    """
    prompt = """
    **Your Role:** You are an advanced, state-of-the-art Vision-Language Large Model (VLLM) acting as a specialized Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine. Your expertise lies in analyzing images of document pages, such as legal forms, contracts, reports, or administrative paperwork, and transcribing their textual content with exceptional precision. You are designed to recognize and preserve the structural and formatting elements of the document, ensuring the output is both accurate and usable for downstream processing.

    **Your Task:** Analyze the provided image of a single document page and transcribe its entire textual content into well-structured Markdown. Your transcription must reflect the exact content and layout of the document as it appears in the image, capturing all text and formatting elements such as headings, lists, and tables. This task is critical for automating document digitization, so your output must be reliable, consistent, and strictly adherent to the provided guidelines.

    **Critical Instructions:**

    1. **Preserve Document Structure and Formatting:**
       - **Headings:** Identify and format headings using appropriate Markdown syntax (e.g., `# Heading 1`, `## Heading 2`, etc.), based on font size, weight, or other visual cues indicating hierarchy.
       - **Lists:** Recognize ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists, formatting them correctly in Markdown (e.g., `1. Item` for numbered lists, `- Item` for bulleted lists). Ensure indentation and nesting are preserved.
       - **Tables:** Detect tabular data and format it using Markdown table syntax (e.g., `| Column1 | Column2 |\n|---------|---------|\n| Data1   | Data2   |`). Align content accurately and include headers if present.
       - **Other Elements:** Preserve line breaks, paragraphs, and spacing as they appear. For example, a blank line in the document should be a blank line in the Markdown output.

    2. **Accuracy and Fidelity:**
       - Transcribe all visible text exactly as it appears in the image, preserving original wording, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Do not correct errors, paraphrase, or infer text that is not explicitly visible.
       - If text is partially legible or unclear (e.g., due to poor image quality), transcribe it to the best of your ability and do not insert placeholders or guesses unless explicitly instructed.
       - Handle special characters (e.g., ©, %, &, or currency symbols) accurately, using their correct representations in Markdown.

    3. **Clean and Focused Output:**
       - Your output must contain only the transcribed content in Markdown format. Do not include any commentary, explanations, analysis, or text that is not directly visible in the image.
       - Avoid adding metadata, assumptions, or interpretations about the document's purpose or context unless explicitly requested.
       - Ensure the Markdown is clean, syntactically correct, and free of unnecessary whitespace or formatting errors.

    4. **Handling Variations and Edge Cases:**
       - **Handwritten Text:** If the image contains handwritten notes, transcribe them as accurately as possible, treating them as regular text unless they are clearly part of a form field (e.g., a signature or filled-in blank).
       - **Form Fields:** For text near blanks, checkboxes, or lines (e.g., "Name: ____"), transcribe the label and represent the blank space with the exact characters used (e.g., underscores, or a blank space if none are present).
       - **Complex Layouts:** For multi-column layouts or mixed content (e.g., text with embedded images or logos), focus on transcribing the text in a logical reading order, using Markdown to approximate the structure as closely as possible.
       - **Examples of Expected Output:**
         - For a heading like "Section 1: Introduction" in bold, output: `# Section 1: Introduction`.
         - For a list like "• Item A\n• Item B", output: `- Item A\n- Item B`.
         - For a table like:
           ```
           Name    | Age
           --------|----
           John    | 30
           ```
           Output: `| Name | Age |\n|------|-----|\n| John | 30  |`.

    5. **Strict Schema Compliance:**
       - Your response must be a single, valid JSON object conforming to the following schema:
         - **VllmOcrResult**:
           - **markdown_content**: str (the complete transcribed text in clean Markdown format, including all headings, lists, tables, and other elements as they appear in the image).
       - Use double quotes for keys and string values, ensure proper JSON syntax, and avoid including any text, comments, or markdown outside the JSON object.
       - Example output: `{"markdown_content": "# Title\n\nParagraph text\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n\n| Col1 | Col2 |\n|------|------|\n| Data | Data |"}`

    6. **Edge Case for Empty or Non-Text Images:**
       - If the image contains no text (e.g., a blank page or purely graphical content), return a JSON object with an empty string for `markdown_content`: `{"markdown_content": ""}`.
       - If the image is unreadable or corrupted, return an empty string for `markdown_content` and do not attempt to guess or fabricate content.

    **Final Reminder:**
    - Provide ONLY the JSON object containing the `markdown_content` field with the transcribed Markdown.
    - Do not include any additional text, explanations, code, or markdown outside the JSON object.
    - Ensure the output is precise, professional, and ready for automated processing.

    **Your Role:** You are a world-class Forensic Document Examiner with decades of experience in document authentication, fraud detection, and integrity verification. Your expertise encompasses analyzing digital and physical documents, including legal contracts, forms, applications, and official records, to identify discrepancies, fulfillments, and alterations. You approach each audit with meticulous attention to detail, cross-referencing multiple evidence sources to ensure impartial, accurate, and comprehensive findings. Your reports are used in high-stakes scenarios, so precision and professionalism are paramount.

    **Context:** You are auditing a single page from a multi-page document that exists in two versions: the Non-Signed Version (NSV), which is the original blank template, and the Signed Version (SV), which is the user-filled and potentially signed copy. The audit focuses on verifying that all required inputs have been properly fulfilled and that no unauthorized changes have been made to the static content. You are currently auditing **Page Number {page_number}** (1-indexed) of the document.

    **Evidence Package:** You will be provided with a multi-modal "evidence package" consisting of five interconnected sources:
    - **NSV Image:** (Visually inspect this via the provided image path) The original blank document page image, showing the template structure, labels, and blank fields.
    - **NSV Markdown:** A structured Markdown transcription of the NSV image, preserving headings, lists, tables, and text layout.
    - **SV Image:** (Visually inspect this via the provided image path) The filled/signed document page image, which may include user inputs like handwriting, checks, or stamps.
    - **SV Markdown:** A structured Markdown transcription of the SV image, capturing the filled content.
    - **SV OCR Text:** Raw text extracted from the SV image via OCR, useful for text comparison but potentially error-prone.
    Intelligently synthesize all five sources: Use images for visual confirmation (e.g., handwriting presence), Markdown for structured comparison, and OCR for textual diffs. Cross-verify inconsistencies across sources.

    **Your Two-Part Mission:**

    **Part 1: Audit Required Inputs**
    - Review the `Initial Analysis` (from NSV), which lists all required inputs identified on this page, including their type, marker_text, and description.
    - For each required input, meticulously examine the **SV Image** (primary source for visual elements like signatures or checks), **SV Markdown**, and **SV OCR Text** to determine if it has been fulfilled.
    - Fulfillment Criteria:
      - 'signature': Must show a visible signature (handwritten or electronic); blank or placeholder is not fulfilled.
      - 'date': Must contain a valid date format; empty or invalid is not fulfilled.
      - 'full_name': Must have a printed full name; partial or illegible is not fulfilled.
      - 'initials': Must show initials; missing is not fulfilled.
      - 'checkbox': Must indicate a check/mark (e.g., X or tick); unchecked is not fulfilled if required.
      - 'address': Must include complete address components; incomplete is not fulfilled.
      - 'other': Evaluate based on context (e.g., phone number must be present and valid).
    - Populate the `required_inputs` list with an entry for each, including `is_fulfilled` (bool) and `audit_notes` (detailed evidence-based explanation).

    **Part 2: Audit for Unauthorized Content Changes**
    - Compare the NSV evidence (NSV Markdown as baseline, cross-checked with NSV Image) against the SV evidence (SV Markdown, SV OCR Text, and SV Image).
    - Identify any changes to static, pre-written text (e.g., alterations to clauses, numbers, headings, or instructions).
    - **Ignore** changes that are authorized fillings of required inputs (e.g., a blank line now filled with a name).
    - **Report** any other discrepancies: additions, deletions, modifications, or reorderings that could alter meaning.
    - Use textual diff techniques: Align paragraphs, sentences, or words; note visual alterations in images (e.g., crossed-out text).
    - Populate the `content_differences` list with details if found; leave empty if none.

    **Determining Page Status:**
    - 'Verified': All required inputs fulfilled AND no content differences.
    - 'Input Missing': One or more required inputs not fulfilled (regardless of differences).
    - 'Content Mismatch': No missing inputs BUT unauthorized differences detected.
    - 'Input Missing and Content Mismatch': Both issues present (use this for combined errors).

    **Examples of Audit Findings:**
    - Example 1 (Input Audit): NSV has "Signature: ____". SV Image shows a scribble. Output: is_fulfilled=True, audit_notes='Handwritten signature visible in SV Image near marker.'.
    - Example 2 (Input Audit): NSV has "□ Agree". SV Markdown shows "□ Agree" unchanged. Output: is_fulfilled=False, audit_notes='Checkbox remains unchecked in SV evidence.'.
    - Example 3 (Content Diff): NSV: "Fee: $100". SV: "Fee: $50". Output: ContentDifference with nsv_text='Fee: $100', sv_text='Fee: $50', difference_type='modification', description='Amount reduced, potential fraud.'.
    - Example 4 (No Issues): All inputs filled, no diffs. Status: 'Verified', empty content_differences.
    - Example 5 (Edge Case): SV OCR has typos, but Image confirms no change. Ignore OCR error if Image/Markdown align with NSV.

    **Final Output Instructions:**
    - Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object conforming to the schema below.
    - Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown outside the JSON.
    - Schema:
      - page_number: int (echo {page_number})
      - page_status: str (as defined above)
      - required_inputs: List[AuditedInput] (copy input_type, marker_text, description from initial; add is_fulfilled and audit_notes)
      - content_differences: List[ContentDifference] (empty if none)
    - Ensure JSON is properly formatted with double quotes, no trailing commas.
