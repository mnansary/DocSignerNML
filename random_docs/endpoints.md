Of course. Here are the fully covered and partially covered API endpoints broken down into two separate tables for clarity.

### **Table 1: Fully Covered API Endpoints**

These endpoints can be implemented with a high degree of confidence using your existing resources.

| # | API Endpoint Name | How It's Covered with Your Resources |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/api/ml/clause/recommend` | The **multimodal LLM** can analyze the contract's context and generate recommendations for suitable legal clauses, using its structured output feature to format them correctly. |
| 2 | `/api/ml/text/simplify` | This is a primary function of an LLM. You can send any complex legal text to the **multimodal LLM** and request a plain-language summary. |
| 3 | `/api/ml/clause/generate` | The **multimodal LLM** can take a natural language prompt (e.g., "Generate a confidentiality clause") and create the full text for the clause. |
| 4 | `/api/ml/document/analyze-risk` | By providing the document's text to the **multimodal LLM**, you can prompt it to identify and list potential risks, ambiguities, or missing information in a structured format. |
| 5 | `/api/ml/document/extract-entities` | The **multimodal LLM** excels at Named Entity Recognition. It can parse the document text and extract key information (names, dates, amounts) into a validated Pydantic object. |
| 6 | `/api/ml/document/ocr` | This is directly handled by your dedicated **lightweight image OCR API**, which is optimized for converting document images to text in English and German. |
| 7 | `/api/ml/task/extract-deliverables` | You can feed the contract text to the **multimodal LLM** and ask it to identify and structure all actionable items, deliverables, and obligations. |
| 8 | `/api/ml/document/translate` | The **multimodal LLM** has strong built-in translation capabilities, allowing it to translate contract text between English, German, and other languages. |

---
| 9 | `/api/ml/chatbot/query` | Your **multimodal LLM** serves as the core "brain" for a conversational agent, capable of understanding and responding to user queries in natural language. |



### **Table 2: Partially Covered API Endpoints**

These endpoints can be partially implemented with your current stack, but would require additional logic, data, or a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for full functionality.

| # | API Endpoint Name | How It's Covered (and What's Missing) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/api/ml/template/suggest` | **What's Covered:** The **multimodal LLM** can provide general suggestions based on a user's description of their needs.<br><br>**What's Missing:** For high accuracy, the model needs to be aware of your specific internal template library. This requires a RAG system to find the most relevant templates from your database and feed them to the LLM as context. |
| 2 | `/api/ml/document/compare-versions` | **What's Covered:** You can use your **OCR API** on two document images and then feed the resulting text to the **multimodal LLM** to get a summary of the differences.<br><br>**What's Missing:** This method is less precise than a dedicated character-by-character "diff" algorithm. The LLM summarizes changes but may not catch subtle modifications perfectly and is less efficient for this specific task. |
| 3 | `/api/ml/document/check-compliance` | **What's Covered:** The **multimodal LLM** has general knowledge of many regulations. Your **Signature Detector API** can verify that a signature exists in a specific location.<br><br>**What's Missing:** The LLM's knowledge is not guaranteed to be current. For reliable compliance, you need to provide the latest legal and regulatory documents as context (using a RAG system) to ensure its analysis is based on up-to-date rules. |
